Server code done by - KYUNGSEOK RYOO

Overview
The project is a Echo Server with 3 functions
1. Accepts messages from the client over TCP
2. Echos back the received messages
3. Handles multiple clients by forking

Architecture
-Server implementation
    Implemented using C.
    Uses TCP sockets to communicate with clients. 
    Each client connection is handled separately using fork()
    Server listens on an ipv4 binging to INADDR_ANY to accept connections. 
-Client Implementation
    Implemented using C.
    Makes use of standard socket libraries and standard c libraries
    as well as string libraries. Input and output buffer are created to handlle
    data being sent and written. Main function is used to create a socket and 
    initialize and connect to server
    Writen function is used for writing to the server as well as reading from server,
    essentially combining the writen and readline functions into one. Errors are also
    handled in this function
    error_sys function is used to print an error message and exit with -1.
    
-Client-Server interaction
    Client connects to the server and sends lines of text.
    Server reads the lines and sends them back to the client.
