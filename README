Server code done by - KYUNGSEOK RYOO

Project is a Echo Server which 3 functions
1. Accepts messages from the client over TCP
2. Echos back the received messages
3. Handles multiple clients by forking

Architecture
-Server implementation
    Implemented using C.
    Uses TCP sockets to communicate with clients. 
    Each client connection is handled separately using fork()
    Server listens on an ipv4 binging to INADDR_ANY to accept connections. 
    
-Client-Server interaction
    Client connects to the server and sends lines of text.
    Server reads the lines and sends them back to the client.

    gcc -o MP1_server.c

2. Running the Server
    ./MP1_server <port>
